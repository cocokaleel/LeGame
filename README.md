The Legume Game

Your main character is a bean, named Garbanzo. You occasionally have a sidekick: Pinto (multi-player).

Storyline:
Garbanzo and his friends, raw beans, are dumped into a heated crockpot! Oh No! If they are in the boiling water too long, they will turn to mush and get eaten by a human.

Gameplay:
Garbanzo can ride bubbles to the surface to escape, but must avoid falling bean carnage and the dreadful ladle-boss. Additionally, bubbles can pop.

You can score points in form of bubble-coin and every time you escape you move on to the next level , which is more difficult and more sparse in bubble-count, and has a different background design. 

Sinking to the bottom of the crockpot doesnâ€™t hurt Garbanzo, but the mush-timer is omnipresent and falling will hurt your chance of escaping the pot before mush mania (final stage, when timer runs out, final big boss).

Different bean characters:
You start as Garbanzo, and eventually can earn Lima (no popping bubbles), Black (a bean dressed as a ninja), Navy (can swim, but must endure unboiled-pasta-missiles), and the top tier, Red Bean, surrounded by a mochi health-sphere.

Experimental feature: the game plays music sometimes and gives you hints in exchange for bubble-coin.
